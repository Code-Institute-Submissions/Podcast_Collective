# Code Institute – Milestone Project 3

<img src="https://www.silverheath.co.uk/images/podcast.jpg" style="margin: 0;">


A collection of recommended podcasts. CRUD (create, Read, update and Delete) has been built into the site to enable authorised users to Edit, Add and Delete podcasts. The Landing page has the read facility.

The project can be viewed at <a>https://podcast-collective.herokuapp.com/</a>



### CONCEPT:
Having completed the third section of the course we received a suggestion was made to create a favourite recipe site.
However, as I do not cook, I wanted to find an alternative. Having recently got into the joy of listening to podcasts I decided to create a site to contain a list of some good examples.

### WIREFRAME:
I have produced two wireframe documents. One for a desktop and the other for mobile phone screen sizes.

* <a href="http://www.silverheath.co.uk/images/podcastmobile.pdf">Mobile Phone</a>


### SOLUTION:
I wanted an easy solution that anyone could access with all the necessary information in one place. Something that would be clear, concise and easy for everyone to use.

### UI/UX:
The site had to be able to be navigated by all levels of users, from beginner to advanced. In addition, all the text had to be easy read, and thought went into the layout to make the site as appealing as possible.

I also wanted the site to be viewable from all devices Mobile Phones, Tablets, Laptops etc.

I considered sorting the navigation links into alphabetical order rather than what I thought would be the most used options first leading to the least used. I finally chose to sort into an order of most used pages first etc.

The colour scheme I used was clear and traditional as was aimed at all ages of visitor.

The landing page was to show a clear summary of all of the podcasts in the database with a button with a link to open up a new page with more detailed information on the podcast selected.


### SECURITY:

For testing and review purposes the admin account details can be used. Username: admin Password: admin
Before final release I would remove this account and also hide the details from the code by using data stored on the server to make site more secure.


### FEATURES:

The colour scheme I used was clear and traditional as was aimed at all ages of visitor.

The landing page was to show a clear summary of all of the podcasts in the database with a button with a link to open up a new page with more detailed information on the podcast selected.

Landing page with a graphical list of the podcasts.

More detail page with podcast description, links etc.

Manage podcast section. This is protected via a username and password gatekeeper. Once the right information has been added a new page will open with a list of the podcasts. For each podcast will be an edit and delete button. At the bottom of the page will be an option to add a new podcast.

Each option will take you to the approriate page to enable the user to make the changes as desired.

Once the change has been made the screen will go back to the list of podcasts with the manage buttons. I did look at the idea of going back to the initial landing page. However I chose this methd as it makes multiple changes easier.



### TECHNOLIGIES USED:

HTML (5)

CSS

Python

MongoDB

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
The project uses __JavaScript__ an object-oriented computer programming language to create interactive effects within web browsers.

<a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a>
The project uses Bootswatch – A source for styling templates.

<a href="https://formspree.io/">Formspree</a>
The project uses Formspree – An email service.



### TESTING:

I have tested this project on the most common browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox. Testing was completed using a locally hosted web server to confirm all links and formatting were working correctly. In addition, I have tested the content using a Google Pixel 4x, Nokia, Apple iPhone and IPad, and the developer kit built into Chrome.

During my testing I have manually checked all the links and buttons for functionality and have also asked my friends and family to check out the site. They have checked for content, spelling and grammar issues and links and button functionality. Their comments and feedback are very appreciated.

I have also used Microsoft word to double-check the spelling and grammar used within the project.
The excellent application Grammarly has also been used throughout this project.

I have used <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">HTML Validator</a> to validate the HTML code and corrected all the major error or warning messages.

I have also uploaded the CSS file to <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS <a>

### INFLUENCES:
I have also used various projects from the Code Institute Submissions GitHub repository for inspiration.

### DEPLOYMENT:
During development, I was using ATOM’s excellent editor and keeping the files backed up onto OneDrive also into a GitHub Repository.

Just before I was about to publish, I used GitPod. I used their Beautify function to make my coding as easy to read as I could. I then pushed that coding into my GitHub repository.
I have hosted the app using Heroku.
Once happy with the result I then renamed the test folder to a more logical name. I then went about submitting the project to the Code Institute for evaluation and feedback.
In addition, I have publicised the project via Facebook and LinkedIn to the project.

### Acknowledgements:
